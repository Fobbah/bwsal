== update ==
void update();

Should be called in AIModule::onFrame.

== getName ==
std::string getName() const;

Returns std::string("Build Order Manager");

== build ==
void build(int count, BWAPI::UnitType t, int priority, BWAPI::TilePosition seedPosition=BWAPI::TilePositions::None);

Order to make the player have the given number of units of the given type. Optionally a tile position may be specified. For example if the player has 4 vultures, and the AI calls build(20,UnitTypes::Terran_Vulture,80) then the Build Order Manager will build vultures until the player has 20 total.

== buildAdditional ==
void buildAdditional(int count, BWAPI::UnitType t, int priority, BWAPI::TilePosition seedPosition=BWAPI::TilePositions::None);

Order to build the given number of units of the given type. Optionally a tile position may be specified. For example if the player has 4 vultures, and the AI calls buildAdditional(20,UnitTypes::Terran_Vulture,80) then the Build Order Manager will build 20 additional vultures, resulting in a total of 24.

== research ==
void research(BWAPI::TechType t, int priority);

Order to research the given tech at the given priority.

== upgrade ==
void upgrade(int level, BWAPI::UpgradeType t, int priority);

Order to upgrade the given upgrade type to the given level at the given priority.

== hasResources ==
  * bool hasResources(BWAPI::UnitType t);
  * bool hasResources(BWAPI::TechType t);
  * bool hasResources(BWAPI::UpgradeType t);

Returns true if the player has enough resources for the given type (taking into account the Build Order Manager's resource reserve system).

== spendResources ==
  * void spendResources(BWAPI::UnitType t);
  * void spendResources(BWAPI::TechType t);
  * void spendResources(BWAPI::UpgradeType t);

Returns true if the player has enough resources for the given type (taking into account the Build Order Manager's resource reserve system).
