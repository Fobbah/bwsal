The build manager is used to build units and buildings. To start building a new unit, simply call BuildManager::build([http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/UnitType UnitType] type).

When a new unit type request comes in, the build manager will pass the unit type off to one of the three sub-build managers:
  * [ConstructionManager Construction Manager] - handles creating new buildings and add-ons
  * [ProductionManager Production Manager] - handles training units from production buildings
  * [MorphManager Morph Manager] - handles morphing units in to other units.


  * [BuildManager#build build]
  * [BuildManager#build_2 build]
  * [BuildManager#getPlannedCount getPlannedCount]
  * [BuildManager#getStartedCount getStartedCount]
  * [BuildManager#getCompletedCount getCompletedCount]
  * [BuildManager#setBuildDistance setBuildDistance]
