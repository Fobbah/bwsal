The UnitGroup class is defined as a std::set<BWAPI::Unit{{{*}}}> object with a number of additional methods:

  * [#getCenter getCenter]
  * [#withinRadius withinRadius]
  * [#operator() operator()]
  * [#not not]
  * [#operator+ operator+]
  * [#operator* operator*]
  * [#operator^ operator^]
  * [#operator- operator-]

operator() can be used to create a UnitGroup that is a subset of the original group. For example, the following 2 lines creates a UnitGroup called myWorkers which holds all the worker units owned by the player:

UnitGroup myUnits=SelectAll()

UnitGroup myWorkers = myUnits(isWorker)

This can be further narrowed down to only idle workers by another call to operator():

UnitGroup myIdleWorkers = myWorkers(isIdle)

Finally, we can compress this to just 1 line:

UnitGroup myIdleWorkers = SelectAll(isWorker)(isIdle)

Also all of the Unit command methods also exist in the UnitGroup class, making it easy to issue the same command to every unit in the UnitGroup.
