#summary Ideas for new BWSAL functionality

Ideas for new BWSAL functionality, in no particular order

= Force Manager =

Not a controller.

A simple manager that can implement basic AI functionality for attacking. A force manager can be used to determine what groups a player's or enemy's units consist of, and can choose a strategy of where to position the player's units. We can use it currently to assign ScoutManager the positions it needs to scout and when. We can also use it to assign DefenseManager a new chokepoint to defend in the case that an expansions is made or lost. This way we can move strategic logic out of ScoutManager (and I would say DefenseManager, but it doesn't even have that =) to pave the way towards fixing it. Later we can split it up into a more complex array of managers, but for now we can use it to implement basic defend, retreat, or later, attack functionality.

= Larva Manager =

Something that predicts and manages larva that haven't spawned yet. Should work with the build order manager to plan what to do with larva when they spawn. It takes about 340 frames (not always the same amount) for a new larva to generate when larva count for a hatchery/lair/hive is less than three.

= Scout Manager =

Improve the scout manager so that it tries to stay alive as long as possible inside the enemy base once it finds the enemy base

Might be possible to split the scout manager into 3 overall tasks or goals:

1) Scout empty base locations to check for new enemy bases

2) Scout enemy bases for tech buildings and production capabilities

3) Scout enemy army for size, unit composition, and position

The first two tasks usually occur at specific points in time (i.e. scout on frame X to see if a Spire or Hydralisk Den was constructed) and might be possible to plan in advance, while the third task is more of a continuous process that starts as soon as the first military unit is created.

The Scout Manager does not determine how important each of these tasks are, or how much units to use. Rather the AI tells the scout manager this information. The role of the scout manager is to scout based on the importance levels (i.e. find the best way to enter and scout the enemy base, given the units it has).

= Other Ideas =

  * Improve the Supply Manager so it uses a more precise algorithm (currently just uses a simple heuristic)
  * Attack Manager - attack stuff, maybe break down into smaller managers
  * Contain Manager - contains the enemy with siege tanks, lurkers, etc.
  * Repair Manager - repair units that are damaged
  * Threat Assessment Manager - influence maps. Determine which tiles are dangerous and how much. Also assign a priority to units that are attacking our base.
  * Risk Adverse Path Manager - moves units to their destination using the safest path (recalculate paths when new threats are discovered i.e. Missile Turrets)
  * Transport Manager - transports units to a given position, perhaps with a priority, using the risk adverse path planner to find safest paths

  * Add a function to the building placer which takes a choke point and list of building unit types (possibly with repetitions) and returns a list of unit type - build position pairs that can be used to block off the choke point.
