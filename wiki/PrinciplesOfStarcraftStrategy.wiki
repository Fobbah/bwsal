== Principles of Macro Mechanics ==
AIs that can implement the following principles effectively _should_ macro well in RTS games.

  # Scout the opponent to find the following types of information about the opponent:
    * Starting location
    * Bases (Expansions + Original Base).
      * Quantity - how many bases?
      * Location - where are the bases?
      * Time of Construction - when were the bases constructed?
      * Approximate Mineral & Gas Gather Rates
    * Production buildings:
      * Type - what type of production buildings?
      * Quantity - how many production buildings of each type?
      * Time of Construction - when was each production building constructed?
      * Location - where are the production buildings located?
    * Tech buildings:
      * Type - what tech path?
      * Quantity - how many tech buildings?
      * Time of Construction - when was each tech building constructed?
      * Location - where are the tech buildings located?
    * Army unit composition:
      * Type Ratio - what types of units are in the opponent's army?
      * Quantity - how many of each unit type?
    * Army position and movement
      * Where is the enemy's main army?
      * Is it moving? If so, why? (Attack | Defend another base | Map control)
  # From the scouting information you should to determine and continuous re-evaluate the following about your strategy:
    * Desired unit composition to counter the enemy's army
    * Desired production buildings composition needed to produce the desired unit composition
  # Use all workers to their "maximal effectiveness"
    * Generally, this means keep workers gathering resources unless their are scouting or constructing a building
  # Avoid these three situations:
    # Supply block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient supply.
    # Production block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient production buildings (i.e. building only 1 factory when you can afford to continuously produce out of 2 factories).
    # Resource block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient resources (i.e. building 3 factories when you can only afford to produce out of 2 factories).
  # Produce the minimum number of desired production buildings to construct your desired army unit composition at the optimal rate (optimal rate = not blocked by any of the three types).
  # Produce workers until they are able to fully saturate the number of bases you plan to have in X minutes. Maybe X is about 3?
  # Never queue up more than 1 unit in any production building. Unless a unit is about to finish.
