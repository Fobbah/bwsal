== Principles of Macro Mechanics ==
AIs that can implement the following principles effectively _should_ macro well in RTS games.

  # Scout the opponent to find the following types of information:
    * Starting location
    * Bases: (Quantity, Location, Time of Construction, Approximate Mineral & Gas Gather Rates)
    * Production buildings (Type, Quantity, Location, Time of Construction)
    * Tech buildings (Type, Quantity, Location, Time of Construction)
    * Army unit composition (Type, Quantity)
    * Army position and movement
  # From the scouting information you need to determine and re-evaluate the following about your strategy:
    * Desired unit composition
    * Desired production facility composition
  # Use all workers to their "maximal effectiveness"
    * Generally, this means keep workers gathering resources unless their are scouting or constructing a building
  # Don't get supply blocked. Supply block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient supply.
  # Don't get production blocked. Production block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient production buildings (i.e. building only 1 factory when you can afford to produce out of 2).
  # Don't get resource blocked. Resource block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient resources (i.e. building 3 factories when you can only afford to produce out of 2).
  # Produce the minimum number of required production structures required to construct your desired army unit composition at the optimal rate.
  # Produce workers until they are able to fully saturate the number of bases you plan to have in X minutes
  # Use knowledge of opponent's army unit composition to determine suitable counter unit composition, given your current unit composition and production capabilities
  # Always use all of your production buildings that can produce a unit in your desired unit composition
  # Make enough production buildings to use all your resources
  # Make the composition of production buildings that can be used to produce your desired unit composition
  # Don't make so many production buildings that you cannot afford to use them all constantly.
  # Never queue up more than 2 units in any building.
