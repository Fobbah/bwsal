AIs that can implement the following principles effectively should perform well in RTS games.

  # Scout the opponent to find the following types of information:
    * Starting location
    * Bases: (Quantity, Location, Time of Construction, Approximate Mineral & Gas Gather Rates)
    * Production buildings (Type, Quantity, Location, Time of Construction)
    * Tech buildings (Type, Quantity, Location, Time of Construction)
    * Army unit composition (Type, Quantity)
    * Army position and movement
  # From the scouting information you need to determine and re-evaluate the following about your strategy:
	* Desired unit composition
	* Desired production facility composition
  # Use all workers to their "maximal effectiveness"
	a) Generally, this means keep workers gathering resources unless their are scouting or constructing a building
4. Don't get supply blocked. Supply block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient supply.
5. Don't get production blocked. Production block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient production buildings (i.e. building only 1 factory when you can afford to produce out of 2).
6. Don't get resource blocked. Resource block: A situation where the limiting factor to your macro is insufficient resources (i.e. building 3 factories when you can only afford to produce out of 2).
7. Produce the minimum number of required production structures required to construct your desired army unit composition at the optimal rate.
7. Produce workers until they are able to fully saturate the number of bases you plan to have in X minutes
8. Use knowledge of opponent's army unit composition to determine suitable counter unit composition, given your current unit composition and production capabilities
9. Always use all of your production buildings that can produce a unit in your desired unit composition
10. Make enough production buildings to use all your resources
11. Make the composition of production buildings that can be used to produce your desired unit composition
12. Don't make so many production buildings that you cannot afford to use them all constantly.
13. Never queue up more than 2 units in any building.
