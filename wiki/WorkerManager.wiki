The worker manager ensures that workers are mining minerals and gas at maximum capacity at each base. Transfers workers to new expansions and balances worker amounts across expansions as needed.

== update ==
virtual void update();

Should be called during AIModule::onFrame.

== getName ==
virtual std::string getName() const;

Returns std::string("Worker Manager");

== onRemoveUnit ==
void onRemoveUnit(BWAPI::Unit{{{*}}} unit);

Should be called during AIModule::onUnitDestroy.

== setWorkersPerGas ==
void setWorkersPerGas(int count);

Used to set how many workers should be used per refinery. The default value is 3 and generally this is the optimal number, but some times in the early game you may want to have only 1 worker on gas.
